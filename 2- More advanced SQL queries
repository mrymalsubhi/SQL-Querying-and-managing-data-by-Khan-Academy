2.1 Challenge: Karaoke song selector

Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. For the first step, select all the song titles. */ 
CREATE TABLE songs ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, artist TEXT, mood TEXT, duration INTEGER, released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("I will survive", "Gloria Gaynor", "epic", 198, 1978);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("Twist and Shout", "The Beatles", "happy", 152, 1963);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("La Bamba", "Ritchie Valens", "happy", 166, 1958);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("I will always love you", "Whitney Houston", "epic", 273, 1992);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("Sweet Caroline", "Neil Diamond", "happy", 201, 1969);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released) VALUES ("Call me maybe", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "happy", 193, 2011);

/* Step 1
Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. For the first step, select all the song titles. */
    
SELECT title FROM songs;

/* Step 2
Maybe your friends only like singing either recent songs or truly epic songs. Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990. (Tip: If you're not sure how to select rows where a column equals a value, remember that you can check the documentation below.) */
SELECT title FROM songs 
WHERE mood = 'epic' OR released > 1990;

/* Step 3
People get picky at the end of the night. Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long. Note that the duration column is measured in seconds. */

SELECT title FROM songs
WHERE  mood = 'epic'  AND released > 1990 AND  duration < 240 ;

INSERT INTO songs (artist, title) VALUES ("Guns N' Roses", "Don't cry");

/* Step 1
We've created a database of songs and artists, and you'll make playlists from them in this challenge. In this first step, select the title of all the songs by the artist named 'Queen'. */ 

SELECT  title FROM songs WHERE artist IN ("Queen"); 

/* Step 2
Now you'll make a 'Pop' playlist. In preparation, select the name of all of the artists from the 'Pop' genre. (Tip: Make sure you type it 'Pop', SQL considers that different from 'pop'.) */

SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre ="Pop"; 

/* Step 3
To finish creating the 'Pop' playlist, add another query that will select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists. It should use IN on a nested subquery that's based on your previous query. */

SELECT title FROM songs WHERE artist IN (SELECT name FROM artists WHERE genre = "Pop" );

2.3 Challenge: The wordiest author
CREATE TABLE books ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, author TEXT, title TEXT, words INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO books (author, title, words) VALUES ("J.K. Rowling", "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", 79944);

INSERT INTO books (author, title, words) VALUES ("J.R.R. Tolkien", "Return of the King", 134462);
    
/* Step 1
We've created a database of a few popular authors and their books, with word counts for each book. In this first step, select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column. /* 

SELECT author, SUM(words) AS total_words FROM books
GROUP BY author
HAVING total_words > 1000000 ;

/* Step 2 
Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. Your results table should include the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column. */

SELECT author, avg(words) AS avg_words FROM books
GROUP BY author 
HAVING avg_words > 150000;

2.4 Challenge: Gradebook

CREATE TABLE student_grades ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, number_grade INTEGER, fraction_completed REAL);   
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed) VALUES ("Winston", 90, 0.805);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed) VALUES ("Winnefer", 95, 0.901);

INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed) VALUES ("Wincifer", 66, 0.7054);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed) VALUES ("Winster", 76, 0.5013);
INSERT INTO student_grades (name, number_grade, fraction_completed) VALUES ("Winstonia", 82, 0.9045);

/* Step 1
We've created a database to track student grades, with their name, number grade, and what percent of activities they've completed. In this first step, select all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed, which you can compute by multiplying and rounding the fraction_completed column. */

SELECT name, number_grade, round (fraction_completed*100)
AS percent_completed FROM student_grades;


/* Step 2 
Now, this step is a little tricky. The goal is a table that shows how many students have earned which letter_grade. You can output the letter_grade by using CASE with the number_grade column, outputting 'A' for grades > 90, 'B' for grades > 80, 'C' for grades > 70, and 'F' otherwise. Then you can use COUNT with GROUP BY to show the number of students with each of those grades. */

SELECT count(*), case
WHEN
number_grade > 90 THEN "A"
WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN "B"
WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN "C" 
ELSE "F" 
END AS letter_grade FROM student_grades 
GROUP BY letter_grade ;
